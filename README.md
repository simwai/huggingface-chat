<h3>A Streamlit web app for interacting with Hugging Face's text generation models.</h3>
</center>

This project is a simple web application that allows users to load pre-trained models from Hugging Face's model hub and generate text based on a user-provided prompt. It's built using Streamlit and the `transformers` library.

## Features

- Load Hugging Face models dynamically by specifying the model name.
- Generate text using the loaded model with a custom prompt.
- Keep a history of loaded models for quick access.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can then install the dependencies with pip:

1. `python -m venv .venv`

2. Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`<br>
   Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`

3. `pip install -r requirements`

## Usage

To run the app, navigate to the directory containing `index.py` and run:

`streamlit run index.py`

The Streamlit web interface should open in your default web browser, where you can interact with the model.
